# FindMyDoctor

GIVEN I am in need of medical care
WHEN I specify specialty and my location
THEN I will receive a list of nearby providers and a map

Our FindMyDoctor app is designed to provide our users with local doctors and specialists that are specific to their needs.
This application takes in the users location and desired specialty input and returns a list of doctors in their area via BetterDoctor API. Each doctor's name, description, clinic, and contact information are provided to the user. Using GoogleMaps API, the user may choose to show on a map exactly where each doctor is located.
